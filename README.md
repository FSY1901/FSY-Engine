# FSY Engine
 A 3D Game Engine.

The Engine can be used and modified for free.
Though libaries are used, that have a license that you must always follow.
These libaries can be found under: FSY\src\vendor. Their respective license/README
can be found in the libaries folder(the one in the vendor folder).

There are two main folders: The 'App'-folder & the 'FSY'-folder.
In the App-folder you can just find an example on how to use the Engine in App.cpp
(Though you can't expect to find nice code all the time as it's just used for testing
purposes!).
The FSY-folder includes the files for the Engine.
